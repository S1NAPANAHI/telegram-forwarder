# Authentication System Fix

## Problem Description

The application was experiencing authentication issues where users would get logged in successfully but then receive 401 Unauthorized errors when accessing protected routes like `/api/keywords`, `/api/channels`, and `/api/logs`.

### Root Causes

1. **Authentication System Mismatch**: There were two different authentication systems running in parallel:
   - Auth routes (`/api/auth/*`) using `tokenService.js` with cookie-based refresh tokens
   - Protected routes using `middleware/auth.js` with different token validation logic

2. **Token Format Inconsistency**: The two systems expected different token formats and validation methods

3. **User Object Structure Mismatch**: Different middleware created different `req.user` object structures

4. **API Configuration**: Frontend was pointing to localhost instead of production backend

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Unified Authentication Middleware

**Updated Files:**
- `backend/middleware/auth.js` - Updated to use `tokenService` for consistent JWT validation
- `backend/middleware/authMiddleware.js` - Created dedicated middleware using `tokenService`

**Changes:**
- All middleware now uses `verifyAccessToken` from `tokenService`
- Consistent user object structure across all routes
- Proper fallback to Supabase auth API when user not found in database
- Better error handling with proper 401 responses

### 2. Updated All Protected Routes

**Updated Routes:**
- `backend/routes/keywords.js`
- `backend/routes/channels.js` 
- `backend/routes/logs.js`
- `backend/routes/destinations.js`
- `backend/routes/monitoring.js`
- `backend/routes/analytics.js`

**Changes:**
- All routes now import and use `authMiddleware` instead of the old `auth` middleware
- Consistent authentication behavior across all protected endpoints

### 3. Fixed Frontend API Configuration

**Updated Files:**
- `frontend/.env.local` - Updated API URL to point to production backend
- `frontend/lib/api.ts` - Improved token refresh logic to prevent loops

**Changes:**
- API now points to `https://backend-service-idry.onrender.com`
- Better request queuing during token refresh
- Improved error handling to prevent infinite refresh loops
- Proper redirect to login only when necessary

### 4. Database Schema Update

**Added Migration:**
- `backend/supabase/migrations/V3__add_user_refresh_tokens.sql`

**Changes:**
- Created `user_refresh_tokens` table for JWT token management
- Added proper indexes and triggers
- Enables the tokenService to store and validate refresh tokens in database

## How Authentication Now Works

### Login Flow
1. User submits credentials to `/api/auth/login-cookie`
2. Backend validates credentials with Supabase Auth
3. Backend generates JWT access token and refresh token using `tokenService`
4. Refresh token stored in database and sent as httpOnly cookie
5. Access token returned to frontend and stored in memory

### API Request Flow
1. Frontend sends requests with `Authorization: Bearer <access_token>` header
2. Backend middleware (`authMiddleware`) validates token using `tokenService.verifyAccessToken`
3. If token valid, user data attached to `req.user` and request proceeds
4. If token expired (401), frontend automatically refreshes token using `/api/auth/refresh`
5. New access token obtained and original request retried

### Token Refresh Flow
1. Frontend detects 401 error on API request
2. Frontend calls `/api/auth/refresh` with refresh token cookie
3. Backend validates refresh token from cookie against database
4. If valid, new access token generated and returned
5. Frontend updates in-memory access token and retries original request

## Key Improvements

1. **Consistent Authentication**: Single source of truth for JWT validation
2. **Better Error Handling**: Proper 401 responses with meaningful error codes
3. **Reduced Token Refresh Loops**: Improved frontend logic prevents infinite refresh attempts
4. **Database Integration**: Refresh tokens properly stored and managed in database
5. **Production Ready**: Correct API endpoints for deployed environment
6. **User Experience**: Seamless authentication without unexpected logouts

## Testing

After deployment, the authentication should work as follows:
1. Login at `/login` should work without errors
2. Accessing `/keywords`, `/channels`, `/logs` should load data successfully
3. Token refresh should happen transparently when tokens expire
4. No more 401 errors in browser console after successful login

## Files Modified

### Backend
- `middleware/auth.js` - Updated JWT validation logic
- `middleware/authMiddleware.js` - Consistent authentication middleware
- `routes/keywords.js` - Updated to use new middleware
- `routes/channels.js` - Updated to use new middleware
- `routes/logs.js` - Updated to use new middleware
- `routes/destinations.js` - Updated to use new middleware
- `routes/monitoring.js` - Updated to use new middleware
- `routes/analytics.js` - Updated to use new middleware
- `supabase/migrations/V3__add_user_refresh_tokens.sql` - New database table

### Frontend
- `.env.local` - Updated API URL
- `lib/api.ts` - Improved token refresh logic

The authentication system is now unified, robust, and should eliminate the 401 errors that were occurring after login.
