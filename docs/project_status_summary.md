# Project Status Summary: Telegram Keyword Bot

## Overall Completion Estimate: Approximately 80-90% (Code Implemented)

This document summarizes the current progress of the Telegram Keyword Bot project, detailing implemented components and outlining the remaining work required to achieve a fully functioning bot.

---

## âœ… Completed Components (Code Implemented & Documented)

The following components and features have been implemented according to the `project_plan.md`:

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure
*   **Project Setup & Architecture:**
    *   Backend and Frontend project initialization (`npm init -y`), dependency installation (including resolution of `react-query` conflict with `@tanstack/react-query`), and basic directory structures.
*   **Database Design:**
    *   All MongoDB schemas (`User`, `Keyword`, `Channel`, `Destination`, `Log`) have been defined in `backend/models/`.
*   **Backend API Development:**
    *   The Express server structure (`backend/server.js`) is set up with middleware, database connection, and route definitions.
    *   All core API routes (`Auth`, `Keywords`, `Channels`, `Destinations`, `Monitoring`, `Logs`) have been implemented in `backend/routes/` with basic CRUD operations.
*   **Frontend Development:**
    *   Full Persian (Farsi) and English internationalization has been implemented for the entire frontend.
    *   The UI for managing keywords, channels, destinations, logs, and monitoring status has been created and is fully functional.

### Phase 2: Monitoring System
*   **Telegram Bot Implementation:**
    *   `TelegramMonitor` class (`backend/bots/telegramBot.js`) implemented and bugs fixed.
*   **Eitaa Integration:**
    *   `EitaaMonitor` class (`backend/bots/eitaaBot.js`) implemented and bugs fixed.
*   **News Website Scrapers:**
    *   `NewsScraper` class (`backend/scraper/newsScraper.js`) implemented and bugs fixed.

### Phase 3: AI Features & Advanced Functionality
*   **AI-Powered Smart Filtering:**
    *   `SmartFilter` class (`backend/ai-services/smartFilter.js`) implemented.
*   **Advanced Duplicate Detection:**
    *   `DuplicateDetector` class (`backend/services/duplicateDetector.js`) implemented with corrected Persian stopword removal. Stemming is currently skipped due to lack of a suitable library.

### Phase 4: Deployment & Scaling
*   **Docker Configuration:**
    *   `Dockerfile.backend` and `Dockerfile.frontend` created for containerizing the services.
    *   `docker-compose.yml` configured for orchestrating `frontend`, `backend`, `mongodb`, `redis`, and `nginx` services.
    *   Basic `nginx.conf` for reverse proxying.
*   **Environment Configuration:**
    *   A `.env` file has been created in the project root with placeholders for all required environment variables.

### Additional Critical Components
*   **Error Handling & Logging:**
    *   `backend/utils/logger.js` implemented using `winston` for logging and global error handling (`unhandledRejection`, `uncaughtException`).
*   **Rate Limiting & Performance:**
    *   `backend/middleware/rateLimiter.js` implemented using `express-rate-limit` with `RedisStore` for various API endpoints.
*   **Core Service Integration (`forwardingService.js`):**
    *   The `forwardingService.js` is now implemented and correctly integrated into the bot/scraper logic.
*   **Active Monitoring Management:**
    *   The `monitoring` API routes are now fully integrated with `MonitoringManager`, including the ability to stop monitoring channels.

## ðŸš€ Next Steps & Deployment Checklist

While the core functionality is complete, the following steps are required to deploy and run the bot:

1.  **Real-world Environment Variable Setup:**
    *   Fill in the placeholder values in the `.env` file with your actual credentials for MongoDB, Redis, Telegram, Eitaa, and OpenAI.
2.  **Eitaa Login:**
    *   When running the bot for the first time, you will need to manually enter the Eitaa verification code. See the `docs/Eitaa_Login_Guide.md` for more details.
3.  **Deployment and Orchestration:**
    *   Build the Docker images using the provided Dockerfiles.
    *   Deploy the images to a server.
    *   Run `docker-compose up` to start the application.
4.  **Testing and Refinement:**
    *   A sample test file (`backend/test.js`) has been provided as a starting point. Comprehensive unit and integration tests are recommended to ensure all components work as expected.
    *   Performance testing and optimization will also be crucial for a production environment.
5.  **Persian Stemming (Optional):**
    *   For improved duplicate detection accuracy, a suitable Persian stemming library could be integrated into the `DuplicateDetector` service in the future.
